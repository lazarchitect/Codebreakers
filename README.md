# Codebreakers
Two-player game I'm working on. Uses Flask as a server to interact with the players on the client side. Game is playable from a browser by using JS and AJAX to send and receive data.

If you are here to download/clone this repo, just know there is some overhead. You need to have a MySQL server set up. Then, create a file at the top level called 'credentials.txt' and fill it up in the following manner:

DB_HOST=(your database hostname)

DB_USERNAME=(your DB login username)

DB_NAME=(your schema name)

DB_PASSWORD=(your DB login password)

DB_PORT=3306
